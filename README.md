# Status:
I'm laying the ground work for a network kind of interface. It needs to be tested, but I don't have anyone to test if a message can be sent and recieved just yet.

If you are near E41S7 and would like to help test, message [Spyingwind](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/Spyingwind) in game or on [Slack](https://screeps.slack.com) in the #screepers channel.
